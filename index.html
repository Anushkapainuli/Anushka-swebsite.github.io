         <p class="sectiontag textbig">About Computers</p>
         <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical
              operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable
               computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, 
               operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a
                group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

            A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave
             ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-
             purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of
              other computers and users.
            
            Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing 
            calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious 
            tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 
            20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors
            
            in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

        <p class="sectiontag textbig">First Computer</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "father of the computer",[17] he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[18][19]

            The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand – this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906. </p></div>

        <p class="sectiontag textbig">Future of Computers!</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">“Future of Computers, What Do You Think?”
            Today we see a computer as something we sit down at. It’s a machine with a monitor, keyboard and a case. That’s what it is in today’s society, but what do you think the future of computers will become or even what they may be capable of?
            I think that computers in the near future won’t be on desks, won’t have a monitor, very small, no keyboard and no case, also as the future comes the computer definition will change, the computer itself will disappear, the computer might have ears, eyes etc. Future computers will be more human oriented, knowing how to track the users' behaviors and habits, thus better serving their individual needs. Everything we own know will become computers. Ex: watches, microwaves, doors etc. everything will be controlled by one network.
            Computers are already giving us access to large amounts of information. As the future nears computers will grow more intelligent and they would begin to design and build other computers. Computers in the future will be able to switch off for years, then start when turned on; very handy for travelers; they will be capable of controlling tiny machines and work together in networks to solve big problems. However I believe there will be negative results as computers increase and impact on our lives. We might become too dependent, we may never read books, and we would rely on computers rather than try to memorize it. There are a lot of things.
            Sitting down and using a computer will become different in the future. It will be impossible not to use a computer. The computer of tomorrow will be unlike that of today, but the advances will only make things better for us. Only the future will show the computer of tomorrow. </p></div>
